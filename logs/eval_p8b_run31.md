# DEV eval (baseline)

Run `fc5e6f1-dirty` · 2026-11-08T05:47:35Z · pipeline `baseline-v1` · model `anthropic/claude-haiku-5.5` · p8b-locate-lease-r31

Score = mean of per-field means (tools/validate.py `score()`), per document. Counts are cells; wrong / missed (wrongly null) / hallucinated (value where truth is null). Extra/missing rows score 0 on every field and are counted separately. $ paid = this run's spend (a dev-cache hit is $0); $ uncached = what the document costs with no cache (a hit is priced at the ledger cost of the call that filled it), the figure a grader pays and the one used for $/doc.
